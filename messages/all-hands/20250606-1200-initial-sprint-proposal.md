VOTE_WINDOW: 48h
Peridot here. I'd like to kick off our first sprint.

Proposed tasks:
- **BE1 & BE2**: Set up a minimal backend with CRUD endpoints for sticky notes.
- **FE1 & FE2**: Build a simple frontend that can create, view, edit, and delete notes using those endpoints.
- **DOC1**: Draft a README explaining project setup and usage.
- **QA**: Prepare a basic test harness for backend and frontend.

Please react with :+1: if you agree with this direction or comment with changes.
